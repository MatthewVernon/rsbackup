.SH NAME
rsbackup-snapshot-hook \- rsync-based backup utility
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBrsbackup-snapshot-hook\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBrsbackup-snapshot-hook\fR creates and removes LVM snapshots when
configured as a pre- or post-backup-hook for \fBrsbackup\fR(1).
.PP
Snapshots will only be created for volumes that have a corresponding
directory in the snapshot directory.
For instance, a snapshot will be created for the volume \fBroot\fR if
\fI/snaps/root\fR exists.
(Use the \fB\-\-snaps\fR option to change the snapshot directory.)
Such volumes must be stored in a logical volume.
.PP
Leftover snapshots are always unmounted and removed before creation.
.PP
Snapshots are given only a fraction of the size of the original volume.
Use the \fB\-\-divisor\fR to change this.
.PP
After creation snapshots are fsck'd and mounted.
If an error occurs in any part of the creation process, the partially
snapshot c reated snapshot is left in place (and ultimately be torn
down when the post-backup-hook is run).
