    <h1>Changes To rsbackup</h1>

    <h2>Changes In rsbackup 0.2</h2>

    <p><code>rsbackup</code> has been rewritten in C++.  The behavior
    is largely same except as follows:</p>

    <ul>

      <li>New <code>--text</code> option generates a plaintext version
      of the report.  In addition the email report includes both the
      text and HTML versions.</li>
      
      <li><code>--prune-unknown</code> is removed.  It is replaced by
      <code>--retire</code>, which is used to remove backups of
      volumes (and hosts) that are no longer in use and
      <code>--retire-device</code> which is used to remove logs for
      devices that are no longer in use.</li>

      <li>The <code>rsync</code> command now includes the
      <code>--delete</code> option, meaning that interrupted backups
      no longer include stray files from the first attempt.</li>
      
      <li><code>.incomplete</code> files are no longer created.
      Instead the logs are used to distinguish complete from
      incomplete backups.</li>

      <li>There are now test scripts.</li>

    </ul>
