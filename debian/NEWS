rsbackup (3.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  Old logfiles from rsbackup versions older than 2.0 (e.g. 1.1-4 shipped
  with jessie) are not supported by rsbackup versions 7.0 and greater.

  You must use a version of rsbackup between versions 2.0 and 6.0 to
  upgrade these old logfiles. This includes those versions of rsbackup
  shipped with stretch and buster.
