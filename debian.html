    <h1>rsbackup and Debian</h1>

    <p>In the <code>.deb</code> package, the default
    <code>/etc/rsbackup/config</code> is as follows:</p>

    <pre class=example># Location of lockfile
lock /var/run/rsbackup.lock

# User configuration
include /etc/rsbackup/local

# Hosts
include /etc/rsbackup/hosts.d</pre>

    <p>Normally you would not edit this file.  Instead, put local
    configuration in <code>/etc/rsbackup/local</code> and a file for
    each host to back up into <code>/etc/rsbackup/hosts.d</code>.</p>

    <p>There is also a configuration file for the cron jobs,
    <code>/etc/rsbackup/defaults</code>.  The default is as
    follows:</p>

    <pre class=example>#
# Set daily=true or daily=false to enable or suppress a daily backup run.
#
daily=true

#
# Set email=ADDRESS to email a report from the daily backup run to
# ADDRESS.
#
email=root

#
# Set hourly="HOST1 HOST2..." to back up named hosts hourly instead of daily.
#
hourly=""

#
# Set prune="OPTIONS" to control weekly pruning options.
#
prune="--prune --prune-incomplete"</pre>

    <p>Leave <code>daily</code> set to <code>true</code> if youâ€™re
      happy with automatic backups every night or set it to
      <code>false</code> if you have some other arrangement for
      initiating backups.  See also
      <code>/etc/cron.daily/rsbackup</code>.</p>

    <p>Set <code>email</code> to the destination address for
      reports from the daily backup run, or comment out the line
      entirely to suppress email reports.  See also
      <code>/etc/cron.daily/rsbackup</code>.</p>

    <p>Set <code>hourly</code> to a list of hosts to attempt to
      back up hourly.  This is intended to be used to
      opportunistically back up hosts that are often down, for
      instance laptops and personal desktops.  See also
      <code>/etc/cron.hourly/rsbackup</code>.</p>

    <p>Modify <code>prune</code> to tune the weekly pruning
      options.  See also <code>/etc/cron.weekly/rsbackup</code>.</p>
