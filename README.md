rsbackup
========

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.com/ewxrjk/rsbackup.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/github/ewxrjk/rsbackup)

rsbackup backs up your computer(s) to removable hard disks.  The
backup is an ordinary filesystem tree, and hard links between repeated
backups are used to save space.  Old backups are automatically pruned
after a set period of time.
