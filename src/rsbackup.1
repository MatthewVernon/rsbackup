.SH DESCRIPTION
Backs up files from one or more (remote) destinations to a single
backup storage directory, preserving their contents, layout,
ownership, permissions, timestamps and hardlink structure.
.SH OPTIONS
.SS "Action Options"
At least one of these options must be specified.
When multiple actions are specified, they are executed in the order
shown below.
.TP
.BR --backup
Make a backup of the selected volumes.
At most one backup of a given volume will be made per day.
.TP
.B --retire-device
Retire the named devices.
Retiring a device means deleting the logfiles for it.
Files on the device itself are not touched.
.IP
If the device is still listed in the configuration file then you will
be asked whether you really want to retire it; you can suppress this
check with the \fB--force\fR option.
.TP
.B --retire-volume
Retire the named volumes.
Retiring a volume means deleting any available backups for the volume
and their corresponding logfiles.
Logfiles on backups for unavailable devices are not removed.
.IP
If you just want to remove logfiles for retired volumes but want to
keep the backups, you should either manually remove the logfiles, or
rename it within the volume.
.IP
If the volume is still listed in the configuration file then you will
be asked whether you really want to retire it; you can suppress this
check with the \fB--force\fR option.
.TP
.BR --prune
Prune old backups of selected volumes.  Any backups that are older
than the \fBprune-age\fR listed for them in the current configuration
will be deleted provided that does not reduce the number of backups
below the volume's \fBmin-backups\fR setting.
.TP
.BR --prune-incomplete
Prune incomplete backups of selected volumes.
Any backups that failed before completion will be removed.
.TP
.B --html \fIPATH\fR
Write an HTML report to \fIPATH\fR.
The report covers all volumes, not just selected ones.
.TP
.B --email \fIADDRESS\fR
Email a report to \fIADDRESS\fR.
.SS "General Options"
.TP
.B --config \fIPATH\fR
The path to the configuration file.
The default is
.IR /etc/rsbackup/config .
.TP
.B --verbose
Enable verbose mode.
Various messages will be displayed to report progress and the rsync
\fB--quiet\fR option is suppressed.
.TP
.B --dry-run
Enable dry-run mode.
Commands will be displayed but nothing will actually be done.
.TP
.B --force
Suppress checks made when retiring devices and volumes.
.TP
.B --wait
Waits rather than giving up if another copy of \fBrsbackup\fR is running.
.TP
.B --help
Display a usage message.
.TP
.B --version
Display the version number.
.SS "Volume Selection"
The list of selectors on the command line determines what subset of
the known volumes are backed up.
The following selectors are possible:
.TP 16
.I HOST
Select all volumes for the host.
.TP
.IR HOST : VOLUME
Select the volume.
.TP
.BI - HOST
Deselect all volumes for the host.
.TP
.BI - HOST : VOLUME
Deselect the volume.
.TP
.B *
Select all volumes.
.PP
If no hosts or volumes are specified on the command line then all volumes are
selected.
.PP
Selectors also choose what host/volumes are retired.
In this case only positive selections are possible.
.SH "CONFIGURATION FILE"
The config file contains global directives and a series of host
stanzas.
Each host stanze in turn contains host directives and volume stanzas.
Although it is not enforced it is suggested that host and volume
stanzas are indented.
.PP
Comments are introduced by an initial "#".
.PP
Command arguments may be quoted, using "double quotes".
Quotes and backslashes within quoted strings are escaped with
backslashes.
.SS "Global Directives"
.TP
.B store \fIPATH\fR
A path at which a backup device may be mounted.
This can be used multiple times.
.TP
.B device \fIDEVICE\fR
Names a device.
This can be used multiple times.
The store must have a file called \fISTORE\fB/device-id\fR which
contains a known device name.
Backups will only be
made to known devices.
.IP
When a device is lost or destroyed, remove its device entry and use the
--prune-unknown option to delete logs of backups on it.
.IP
Device names may contain letters, digits, dots and underscores.
\" .TP
\" .B max-usage \fIPERCENT\fR
\" Device usage limit.
\" If more of the device is in use than this percentage then it
\" will be marked in red in the report.
\" The default is 80.
\" .TP
\" .B max-file-usage \fIPERCENT\fR
\" Device usage limit.
\" If more of the device's file (inode) limit is in use than this
\" percentage then it will be marked in red in the report.
\" The default is 80.
.TP
.B public
The store is public.
Normally the store must only be accessible by the calling user.
This option suppresses the check.
.TP
.B logs \fIPATH\fR
The directory to store logfiles.
The default is \fI/var/log/backup\fR.
.TP
.B lock \fIPATH\fR
Enable locking.
If this directive is present then \fIPATH\fR will be used as a lockfile
for operations that change anything (--backup, --prune, etc).
.TP
.B ssh-timeout \fISECONDS\fR
How long to wait before concluding a host is down.  The default is 3.
.TP
.B max-age \fIDAYS\fR
The maximum age of the most recent backup before you feel uncomfortable.
The default is 3, meaning that if a volume hasn't been backed up in
the last 3 days it will have red ink in the HTML report.
.TP
.B min-backups \fICOUNT\fR
The minimum number of backups for each volume to keep on each store,
when pruning.
The default is 1.
.TP
.B prune-age \fIDAYS\fR
The age at which a backup may be pruned.
The default is 366, meaning a backup will never be pruned until it is
at least a whole year old.
.TP
.B keep-prune-logs \fIDAYS\fR
The number of days to keep prune logs for.
The default is 31.
.TP
.B include \fIPATH\fR
Include another file as part of the configuration.
If \fIPATH\fR is a directory then the files within it are included
(excluding dotfiles and backup files).
.SS "Host Directives"
A host stanza is started by a host directive.
It contains other host directives, and one or more volume stanzas.
.TP
.B host \fIHOST\fR
Introduce a host stanza.
The name is used for the backup directory for this host.
.TP
.B hostname \fIHOSTNAME\fR
The SSH hostname for this host.
The default is the name from the host stanza.
.IP
The hostname \fBlocalhost\fR is treated specially: it is assumed to always be
identical to the local system, so files will be read from the local filesystem.
.TP
.B user \fIUSERNAME\fR
The SSH username for this host.
The default is not to supply a username.
.PP
In addition, \fBprune-age\fR, \fBmax-age\fR and \fBmin-backups\fR can
be used within a host stanza, and apply to just that host.
.SS "Volume Directives"
A volume stanza is started by a volume directive.
It contains one or more volume directives.
.TP
.B volume \fIVOLUME PATH\fR
Introduce a volume stanza.
The name is used for the backup directory for this volume.
The path is the absolute path on the host.
.TP
.B exclude \fIPATTERN\fR
An exclusion for this volume.
The pattern is passed to the rsync \fB--exclude\fR option.
This directive may appear multiple times per volume.
.IP
See the rsync man page for full details.
.TP
.B traverse
Traverse mount points.
This suppresses the rsync \fB--one-file-system\fR option.
.PP
In addition, \fBprune-age\fR, \fBmax-age\fR and \fBmin-backups\fR can
be used within a volume stanza, and apply to just that volume.
.SH "BACKUP LIFECYCLE"
.SS "Adding A New Host"
To add a new host create a \fBhost\fR entry for it in the configuration file.
.PP
To back up the local host, specify \fBhostname localhost\fR.
Otherwise you can usually omit \fBhostname\fR.
.PP
You may want to set host-wide values for \fBprune-age\fR,
\fBmax-age\fR and \fBmin-backups\fR.
.PP
A host with no volumes has no effect.
.SS "Adding A New Volume"
To add a new volume create a \fBvolume\fR entry for it in the relevant
\fBhost\fR section of the configuration file.
.PP
Add \fBexclude\fR options to skip files you don't want to back up.
This might include temporary files and the contents of "trash"
directories.
.PP
If the volume contains mount points, and you want to back up the
contents of the subsiduary filesystems, then be sure to include the
\fBtraverse\fR option.
.PP
You may want to set per-volume values for \fBprune-age\fR,
\fBmax-age\fR and \fBmin-backups\fR.
.SS "Adding A New Device"
To add a new device, format and mount it and create a
\fIdevice-id\fR file in its top-level directory.
Add a \fBdevice\fR entry for it in the configuration file and a
\fBstore\fR entry mentioning its usual mount point.
.PP
Under normal circumstances you should make sure that the backup
filesystem is owned by root and mode 0700.
.SS "Making Backups"
Run \fBrsbackup --backup\fR to back up all available volumes to all
available devices.
You will probably want to automate this.
To only back up a limited set of volumes specify selection arguments
on the command line.
.SS "Pruning Backups"
Run \fBrsbackup --prune --prune-incomplete\fR to prune old backups.
You will probably want to automate this.
.PP
You may want to prune incomplete backups slightly less often than
complete ones, as this can sometimes save work for subsequent backups.
.SS "Retiring A Host"
Retiring a host means removing all backups for it.
The suggested approach is to remove configuration for it and then use
\fBrsbackup --retire \fIHOST\fR to remove its backups too.
You can do this the other way around but you will be prompted to check
you really meant to remove backups for a host still listed in the
configuration file.
.PP
If any of the backups for the host are on a retired device you should
retire that device first.
.SS "Retiring A Volume"
Retiring a volume means removing all backups for it.
It is almost the same as retiring a whole host but the command is
\fBrsbackup --retire \fIHOST\fB:\fRVOLUME\fR.
.PP
You can retire multiple hosts and volumes in a single command.
.SS "Retiring A Device"
Retiring a device just means removing the logs for it.
Use \fBrsbackup --retire-device \fIDEVICE\fR to do this.
The contents of the device are not modified; if you want that you must
do it manually.
.PP
You can retire multiple devices in a single command.
